# GoalBingoApp
Goal Bingo is a mobile-friendly web app that turns goal-setting into a bingo game. You build a custom board, tap to complete goals, and aim for a BINGO (i.e. 5 in a row). The app is built with React + Vite, styled with CSS and persists data in browser storage with free hosting. It's packaged as a PWA so it can be installed to a phone's home screen
